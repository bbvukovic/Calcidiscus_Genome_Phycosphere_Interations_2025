Processing of 16S sequencing data for the *Calcidiscus* genome&phycosphere paper

This repository is accompanying to the manuscript in preparation: **Frederic Chaux, Tanja Vojvoda-Zeljko, Borna Branimir Vuković, Titouan Le Perrun, Marta Žižek, Bridget P. Bannerman, Clotilde Garrido, John Burns, Zhou Xu, Richard G. Dorrell, Jelena Godrijan. Reference genome of calcifying phytoplankton *Calcidiscus* reveals vitamin-mediated holobiont interactions**

It contains the scripts for analysis of data obtained by sequencing the V3-V4 region of 16S rDNA, obtained via Illumina MiSeq. The analysis was done in the QIIME2 platform (https://qiime2.org/), and taxonomic classifier training was done via the University of Zagreb's SRCE high-performance computing infrastructure.
